        "Attribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid attribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So, if the class definition looked like this:\n",
        "```\n",

        "then *MyClass.i* and *MyClass.f* are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object, respectively. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Instantiation\n",
        " Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function that returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):\n",
        "```\n",
        "x = MyClass()\n",
        "```\n",
        "creates a new *instance* of the class and assigns this object to the local variable *x*.\n",
        "The instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state. Therefore a class may define a special method named *__init__()*, like this:\n",
        "```\n",
        "def __init__(self):\n",
        "    self.data = []\n",

        "x = MyClass()\n",
        "```\n",

        "## Instance Objects\n",
        "Now what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute references. There are two kinds of valid attribute names: data attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "*data attributes* correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++. Data attributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are first assigned to. For example, if *x* is the instance of *MyClass* created above, the following piece of code will print the value 16, without leaving a trace:\n",
        "```\n",
        "x.counter = 1\n",
        "while x.counter < 10:\n",
        "    x.counter = x.counter * 2\n",
        "print(x.counter)\n",
        "del x.counter\n",
        "```\n",
        "The other kind of instance attribute reference is a *method*. A method is a function that “belongs to” an object. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods as well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on. However, in the following discussion, we’ll use the term method exclusively to mean methods of class instance objects, unless explicitly stated otherwise.)\n",
        "Valid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By definition, all attributes of a class that are function objects define corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, *x.f* is a valid method reference, since *MyClass.f* is a function, but *x.i* is not, since *MyClass.i* is not. But *x.f* is not the same thing as *MyClass.f* it is a *method object*, not a function object.\n",
